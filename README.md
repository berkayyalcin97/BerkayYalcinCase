# BerkayYalcinCase
In this case study, I received earthquake information from api and then processed the necessary data for the user to display it. I used Java, Spring technologies to complete the Project.
The user can see the earthquake data of the entered country up to the desired day in the log and on the web in json format. In addition, if there is no earthquake data for the specified country, it can see the message about it both in the log and on the web
